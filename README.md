# RPS 

RPS is a website created by Parker Bruni for CS290

RPS features the ability to play rock paper scissors using points that are added to a users account data located in a mySQL database

users may create accounts on the server and log in to their own account to keep track of points

There are known bugs, refreshing page solves a few, perhaps one day I will fix them all (NOT)

Languages used to write this website: HTML, PHP, Javascript, MySQL, AJAX (sort of). 

gamble your points away safely
